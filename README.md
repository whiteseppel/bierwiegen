This is a project digitalizing a party drinking game. 

## Improvements

### Integration Bluetooth Scale
- Order the "Decent Scale".
- Optimize Input flow for the use of Bluetooth.

### Usability
- After adding a round the focus should jump straight to the first field
  in the row so that users can start typing immediately.

### Layout
- We need to take the number of players and the screen orientation into
  consideration when setting the layout for the grid view - otherwise the
  items will be displayed with may too much spacing inbetween
