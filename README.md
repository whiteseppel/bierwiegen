## Ideas for project improvement

### Save previous games
I want to show my friends the games of the previous days and flex how close
i got several times to the weight

### Game modes
I want to have 2 game modes:
- Regular Mode: only the one with the closest score gets one point
- Point Mode: first place gets 3 points, second 2 and third 1. If you get the target 
  exactly you get 5 points.

### Short animation after each round
I want to have a short animation after finishing each round before the next round is
started.

### Configure players
I want to configure players to enter the name (and the game should remember previous players)
