## Ideas for project improvement

### Save previous games
I want to show my friends the games of the previous days and flex how close
i got several times to the weight

### Game modes
I want to have 2 game modes:
- Regular Mode: only the one with the closest score gets one point
- Point Mode: first place gets 3 points, second 2 and third 1. If you get the target 
  exactly you get 5 points.

### Short animation after each round
I want to have a short animation after finishing each round before the next round is
started.

### Configure players
I want to configure players to enter the name (and the game should remember previous players)

### Teammode
I want to have a mode where players are in a team and play together against another team - a 
team wins the round if all people have a combined lower offset as the other team.


## Further Ideas
Easy Mode for beginner players - when you start with the game you do not have to be exactly on 
the weight to get better results compared to users that have played the game for some time.
